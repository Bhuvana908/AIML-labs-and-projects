# üéØ Classification ‚Äì Module 1 (KNN)

This folder introduces **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and explores its applications with different distance metrics, text classification, and a from-scratch implementation.

## üìÇ Contents
1. **Understanding Distance Metrics & Introduction to KNN**  
   - Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Hamming, Chebyshev, Jaccard, Haversine, Cosine Similarity  
   - Implementing KNN using different metrics  

2. **Using KNN for Text Classification**  
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing (NLTK)  
   - Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature extraction  
   - TF-IDF technique to improve BoW limitations  
   - KNN models with BoW vs TF-IDF  

3. **Implementing KNN from Scratch & Visualizing Performance**  
   - Building KNN algorithm manually  
   - Plotting Voronoi diagrams & decision boundaries  
   - Evaluating with a confusion matrix  

4. **Project**  
   - A project applying concepts from this module
